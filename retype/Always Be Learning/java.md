# Getting into Java

My latest role has allowed me to start learning Java as it is used heavily for API and backend. I am really loving it and regret not picking it up
sooner. 

Super strong typing and verbose nature makes me happy after years of developing with PHP. I am seeing a large number of similarities between Java and
the latest PHP 8.1 release, and I like it. :+1:

Here are some links to videos and courses I have completed and what I am working on at the moment.

!!!primary Current Course
Pathway on [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/learn)

[Java for Programmers](https://www.educative.io/path/java-for-programmers)

Online with sample code and browser based IDE. There are examples and exercises to complete, and you can run the code online in the browser based
IDE. 

What I am really liking is that there are no videos, it's all read & write based learning. After so many video courses I think this format is great 
and helps with memory retention.
