# What I am Learning

This section is going be my current learning curriculum. I will post info about training that I am currently undertaking from 
books, courses, videos etc. You can see most of my training history via the [Degreed](https://degreed.com/profile/mrwilde/skills), dating back 5+ years. 

As much as I like that site has numerous issues with its functionality and has not changed much in the 5 years I have been using it. I decided I should
have my own online reference for these, if only for my personal reflection and study. If you find any of this info useful or helpful then fantastic.
If you have any questions about any of the info provided, feel free to reach out maybe via Twitter or 
my special email [questions@mrwilde.com](mailto:questions@mrwilde.com)
