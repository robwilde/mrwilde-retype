My Favourite videos on YouTube now are everything from [@kirksorensen](https://twitter.com/kirksorensen), by [@gordonmcdowell](https://twitter.com/gordonmcdowell), talking about Thorium and Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor.

Right at the start Kirk outlines an estimated $1000,000,000 return from 1 Tonne of Thorium.

This doc I found from 2007, , outlines not only is Australia the largest deposit of Thorium on the planet, but we also have 452,000 Tonnes.

So you don't hurt yourself, as it was hurting my head getting around that number, let me show what that is in dollars. $452 000, 000, 000, 000 or $452 TRILLION. 
Even you dumped a billion into an investment or 5 billion, how could you not get a return.

I am no financial guru or anything like that but seriously what am I missing? How is this not the next big boom for this country? Imagine a publicly owned company producing clean power from an abundant source, mined locally that could also produce FUEL. There is a process, that has been tested and proven, that can create aviation fuel that is more efficient and cleaner than oil based petroleum.  So basically Petrol from Sea Water and better and cleaner than from oil PLUS it will remove Co2 from the atmosphere. Watch below; it will blow your mind.

Thorium is the new GOLD and nearly every other precious metal all rolled into one, and it is everywhere. Not only generate power efficiently, with ZERO emission, but it has

- a short-life waste ( around 300 years opposed to current 10, 000 years)
- desalinate water
- produce very rare fuel for deep space missions
- create unique isotopes which help fight cancer
- assist in the production aviation fuel from seawater

OMG-WTF It's like aliens have landed, given us the answers to most of the major world problems and we just shrug and say cool, then go about the day. My drive in life now is to generate enough recurring revenue in business so I can spend more time learning about this technology and maybe even studying Nuclear Engineering. If you want something done, sometimes you have to do it yourself. I want my son living in a world powered by ‪#‎LFTR‬ ‪#‎Thorium‬

Please comment, what do you think. If you disagree with anything here, tell me. We need to discuss this and talk about this as much as possible. It is not new technology it was discovered over 50 Years ago and forgotten. The more we talk about it, the more people know and the closer we are to the world running on #Thorium #LFTR
