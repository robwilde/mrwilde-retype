# About Me

Who is Mr Wilde?

I am just am guy, getting on in life, who just loves building things.

I have worked in and around tech for more than 30 years now, from electronic engineer to technical director of a nightclub. 
I was self-employed for more than a decade starting with systems administration of Windows servers and finished up building website with WordPress.

As I draw near the big 50, I am still wanting to learn more and grow. I have worked with PHP for the last 5 years and now learning Java. 
I can't stop learning, it keeps me feeling young and gets me out of bed every day.

When I am not writing code I love to build PC's, go for rides on one of my Motorcycles or I will be watching another video 
on Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors.
